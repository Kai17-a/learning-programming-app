// Problem: Pointer Usage Intermediate Practice
// Topic: Pointer Usage
// Difficulty: 2

package main

// TODO: This is a intermediate level problem focusing on pointer usage
// Section: Pointer syntax and memory references
// Syntax elements to practice: pointer to struct, pointer receivers, pointer arithmetic

    fmt.Println("Problem 5: Pointer Usage - Intermediate Level")

// TODO: Implement your solution here
// Focus on practicing: pointer to struct, pointer receivers, pointer arithmetic

// TODO: Add appropriate variable declarations, control structures, or function calls
// based on the topic and difficulty level

// Example structure - modify as needed:
// 1. Declare variables related to pointer usage
// 2. Implement logic using pointer to struct, pointer receivers, pointer arithmetic
// 3. Display results using fmt package
