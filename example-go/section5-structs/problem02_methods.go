// TODO: This is a basic level problem focusing on methods
// Section: Structure definitions and method implementations
// Syntax elements to practice: method declaration, receiver types, pointer receivers

    fmt.Println("Problem 2: Methods - Basic Level")

// TODO: Implement your solution here
// Focus on practicing: method declaration, receiver types, pointer receivers

// TODO: Add appropriate variable declarations, control structures, or function calls
// based on the topic and difficulty level

// Example structure - modify as needed:
// 1. Declare variables related to methods
// 2. Implement logic using method declaration, receiver types, pointer receivers
// 3. Display results using fmt package
